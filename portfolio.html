                                This project was my undergraduate capstone project. My group and I developed a drone-based system
                                to autonomously patrol parking lots and use license plate recognition technology to enforce parking
                                permits. Our system used a DJI Mavic Pro running custom firmware, with a field-based Android device
                                linking back to a central server. This system offered a fast, cost-effective, highly scalable solution
                                to parking enforcement, especially on large scales such as a university campus.

                                Hardware fuzzing is a recently developed technique for identifying vulnerabilities in hardware designs. 
                                Since March of 2023, I have had the opportunity to work on a hardware fuzzing project in the SeTH Lab at Texas A&M University.
                                The basic concept of hardware fuzzing is to generate random inputs to a hardware design and observe the outputs. By doing this
                                we can identify any misbehavior in the processor to find vulnerabilities. This is a very new field of research, and I am excited
                                to be able to contribute. You can read more about our hardware fuzzer, TheHuzz, on the

                                Web crawlers are used to explore the internet and collect data. Using an object-oriented approach, I developed a 
                                multi-threaded web crawler in C++ for scraping links from HTTP/1.0 websites. The crawler honored robots.txt files 
                                and was proven to scale to over 5000 threads and explore millions of links. This project used extensive memory and 
                                thread management to ensure that the crawler was efficient and scalable.

                                This was a group project used to explore software engineering princples. In the first phase of the project, we developed
                                a desktop GUI application using Java. The application would be used as a complete restaurant system, allowing cashiers to 
                                take customer orders and managers to view inventory data. Placing an order automatically updated inventory levels, which
                                were stored in a SQL database, and managers could view sales data and inventory analytics, such as popular items. managers
                                could also update inventory levels and add new items to the menu.

                                In the second phase of the project, we developed a web-based version of the application using Python Flask and JavaScript. 
                                The web application expanded on the functionality by including a customer interface for placing orders online, as well 
                                as a real-time order status display for kitchen staff. The web application was developed using the Agile methodology and 
                                was hosted on a cloud server. This was an excellent exercise in teamwork, software engineering princples, and full-stack,
                                end-to-end development.

                                peripheral. The peripheral was a simple multiplier designed in Verilog. The driver was written in C and interfaced with the
                                peripheral using memory-mapped I/O. The driver was able to send data to the peripheral, receive the result, and then display
                                the result to the user. I designed and tested the system on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. This project was a great exercise in

                                This was a fun project that combined my love of cars with my passion for engineering. Using an Arduino Nano and a handful of 
                                hobbyist electronics, I built a digital tachometer for my car. The tachometer is a device that measures the RPM of the engine.
                                By wiring the ignition coil through a <a class="external_link" href="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/arduino/original/4X/2/0/c/20c65bb1880715cd9be32c842d151c8ff1a2652c.png">filter</a>
                                to the Arduino, I was able to measure the frequency of the ignition pulses and calculate the RPM. I then used a 7-segment 
                                display to display the RPM on the windshield as a heads-up display, as well as a strip of colored LEDs. This was an extremely 
                                fun project that allowed me to apply my engineering skills. Ultimately, my tachometer proved to be too distracting and only 
                                moderately accurate, but it was a fantastic project nonetheless.

                                Almost everyone has some form of home automation nowadays, whether it's a smart thermostat, a wifi-controlled lightbulb, or an 
                                Amazon Echo. I took this even further and built a home automation system from scratch. Using a Raspberry Pi and a platform
                                called <a class="external_link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">"Home Assistant,"</a> I created a 
                                <a class="external_link" href="https://www.z-wave.com/">Z-Wave</a> network to control my bedroom lights, my window blinds, and my 
                                front door. The system has some awesome capabilities, like scheduling the blinds to open at sunrise, or turning on the lights 
                                when I walk in the room. I learned a lot by building this system and had a great experience 
                                interfacing software programming with real-world devices.
