			<div class="about_me"> Hi there! I'm Kyle Minihan, a Master's Student in Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University. 
					I specialize in software development, digital signal processing, and embedded systems.
					I am currently seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2026.</div>
			<h2 class="main_heading">My Story</h2>
			<div class="content_block">
				<!-- <p class="indent">
					I grew up in Northern Virginia, where I witnessed and admired the hard work and advanced technology that goes into national 
					security. This ignited a passion for security in me and set me on the path toward a career in service of my nation.
				</p> -->
				<p class="indent">
					I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M, where I received a top-notch education and gained valuable research experience. My coursework in computer engineering 
					gave me a wide breadth of knowledge of computer systems, from top-level software development down to low-level hardware interactions.
					<!-- My cybersecurity minor developed my skills in the fundamentals of cybersecurity.  -->
					Working as an undergraduate researcher in the Secure and Trustworthy Hardware 
					Lab, I gained valuable research experience while also learning the principles of security at the hardware level. My commitment
					to academic success allowed me to maintain a 4.0 GPA while also participating in undergraduate research. My academic success has
					initiated my path to the forefront of new technologies.
					In my education at Carnegie Mellon University, I am focusing on computer architecture and signal processing. 
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					My experience in both academics and research has given me a diverse set of skills. Collaborative projects in both my coursework
					and research have developed my soft skills including teamwork, communication, and project management. My research experience has
					given me valuable problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. I have also developed many hard skills, including hardware simulation
					and hardware fuzzing, software development, FPGA programming, and more.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					In my internships, I have grown a wide range of technical skills, especially in signal processing and GPU development. I have conducted
					industry work in image processing, GPU-based clustering algorithms, embedded system design, and more. My work experience has confirmed
					that I have a passion for hands-on technical work at the cutting edge of technology. I have industry experience signal filtering and 
					Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs), development in both Nvidia CUDA and Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP), and 
					Nvidia Jetson-based embedded Linux devices.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					My professional aspirations are guided by a desire to work at the leading edge of technology and to continually develop my expertise.
					My strong education and diverse experience enable me to pursue new ideas and explore uncharted territories. In my career,
					I aim to stretch the limits of what is possible by pushing myself to be the best I can be.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					In my spare time, you might find me working out or tinkering with old cars. I recently completed my second triathlon, and I am currently training for an Ironman 70.3.
					I also love working with my hands. I restored a 1970 Mustang with my dad, seen in the picture above. I have also earned my private pilot's license, and I try to fly
					in my free time as much as possible.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					On this website, you can learn more about me and the projects that I have worked on. I encourage you to take a look around, and please
					feel free to contact me with any questions or opportunities. Thank you for visiting!
